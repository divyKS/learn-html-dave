# Learning HTML

This repository contains the code that I did when learning HTML from [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE).

I learnt - 
1. **Semantic HTML**: Proper usage of semantic HTML tags, such as `<header>, <nav>, <section>, <main>, <article>, <footer>, <aside>, <details>, <summary>, <mark>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <time>, <address>, <abbr>` etc.
  
2. **Accessibility**: Learnt a few ways to make our web page more accessible to screen readers etc.
     - Use of `aria-label` attribute for accessibility in the <nav> tag.
     - Proper labeling using the `for` attribute in label tags, associating them with form elements.
     - Use of the `autocomplete` attribute to improve user experience in form fields.
     - Utilization of the `placeholder` attribute for providing hints in form fields.
     - Application of `required` attribute for mandatory form fields.

3. **SEO Optimization**: Inclusion of `<meta>` tags in the head section, like `<meta name="author" content="Eren Yeager" />`  and `<meta name="description" content="This is all my learnings from the HTML tutorial!" />`, for search engine optimization.
Navigation:

4. Internal linking using anchor tags with href attributes pointing to specific sections within the page (#firstSection, #secondSection, #contactSection).
5. **Embedding images** with the `<img>` tag, specifying attributes like src, alt, title, width, and height. Use of the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags for grouping and captioning images.
Lists:
6. Various types of hyperlinks, including absolute and relative references, email links, telephone links, and links to download files.
7. **Forms**: Form creation using the form tag with various form elements like text input, password input, radio buttons, checkboxes, textarea, and dropdowns.
8. **Tables**: Proper structure of tables using `<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, <th>, <tr>, and <td>` tags. Use of the `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes to merge cells in tables.
